                <p>Here's some information about project creation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The final URL of a project is in the format
                    <tt>openlab.org/name/slug</tt>, where <tt>name</tt> is name
                    of the responsible organization or user.</li>

                    <li>The <tt>slug</tt> is generated from the title.</li>

                    <li>After the project is (somewhat) complete, including a
                    photograph of a physical prototype of the project, you can
                    publish a 1.0 "Release" of the project.
                    <li>A Release indicates a mature product, and  earns
                    prominent placement on Open Lab.</li>

                <h3>Are you part of a team?</h3>
                <p>If you're part of a organization, first register a team with
                Open Lab and add your teammates to it. This will allow multiple
                people to easily collaborate on the project.</p>
